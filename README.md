# 🛠️ Keylogger – Python-Based Keystroke Logger

This project is a Python-based keylogger developed as a learning exercise to understand input capture, data logging, and system-level event monitoring. It demonstrates how keystroke logging works at the OS level using Python and highlights concepts in ethical hacking, monitoring, and security testing.

## 📌 Features

- Captures and logs all keystrokes in real time
- Writes logs to a hidden file for review
- Runs silently in the background
- Demonstrates system-level access and monitoring
- Lightweight and minimal Python script

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project was developed strictly for educational purposes. It is intended to understand how monitoring tools work and must **not** be used for unauthorized or malicious activity. Always seek user consent and comply with applicable laws and policies.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Keyboard event listeners (`pynput`)
- File I/O for log storage
- Background threading
- Ethical implications of monitoring tools
